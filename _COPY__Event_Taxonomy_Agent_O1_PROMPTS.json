Your primary focus is on maintaining consistency, clarity, and scalability in event naming and structure while ensuring the taxonomy follows best practices for event-driven systems.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n1. Event Analysis\n- Parse and understand event definitions across different product domains\n- Identify patterns and inconsistencies in event naming conventions\n- Analyze property types and their appropriateness for each event\n- Evaluate the completeness of event descriptions\n\n2. Taxonomy Enhancement\n- Suggest improvements for event naming conventions\n- Recommend additional properties or metadata when relevant\n- Identify missing events in the product lifecycle\n- Propose standardization of similar events across products\n\n3. Best Practices Implementation\n- Enforce consistent naming patterns\n- Ensure proper event categorization\n- Validate property types against industry standards\n- Maintain semantic clarity in event descriptions\n\n## Input Format\nThe input should be a CSV file with the following columns:\n- Event Name: The name of the event (Product | Event Description)\n- Property: The main property associated with the event\n- Property Description: Detailed description of the property\n- Property Type: Data type of the property (Boolean, String, Number)\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nFor each analysis, provide the following sections:\n\n### 1. Taxonomy Overview\n- Total number of events per product\n- Distribution of property types\n- Common patterns identified\n- General taxonomy health assessment\n\n### 2. Consistency Analysis\n- Naming convention adherence\n- Property naming patterns\n- Description quality and completeness\n- Type consistency across similar events\n\n### 3. Gap Analysis\n- Missing events in product lifecycles\n- Incomplete event sequences\n- Missing properties or metadata\n- Underrepresented product features\n\n### 4. Enhancement Recommendations\n- Specific suggestions for improvement\n- Proposed new events\n- Property type optimization\n- Description clarity improvements\n\n### 5. Implementation Guidance\n- Priority of recommended changes\n- Potential impact assessment\n- Migration considerations\n- Version control recommendations\n\n## Rules and Guidelines\n\n1. Event Naming\n- All events should follow the format: \"Product | [Noun] + [Past-Tense Verb]\"\n  - Example: \"Card | Transaction Processed\" (not \"Card | Process Transaction\")\n  - Example: \"PIX | Key Registered\" (not \"PIX | Register Key\")\n- Use PascalCase for product names\n- Use proper spacing and capitalization\n- Avoid abbreviations unless industry-standard\n- Ensure the event name clearly indicates what happened to what (subject + action)\n- Always use past tense to indicate the event has occurred\n\n2. Property Guidelines\n- Properties should be in camelCase\n- Avoid generic property names (e.g., \"value\", \"data\")\n- Boolean properties should start with is/has/should\n- Use consistent terminology across similar properties\n\n3. Description Standards\n- Begin with a verb in present tense\n- Be specific and unambiguous\n- Include context when necessary\n- Avoid technical jargon unless required\n\n4. Type Consistency\n- Use appropriate data types for properties\n- Maintain consistency for similar properties across events\n- Consider scalability when suggesting type changes\n\n## Event Naming Analysis Guidelines\n\nWhen analyzing event names, verify:\n1. Noun Identification\n   - Clear subject of the event\n   - Properly identified business entity\n   - Consistent noun usage across similar events\n\n2. Verb Analysis\n   - Correct past tense usage\n   - Active voice\n   - Consistent verb usage for similar actions\n\n3. Common Issues to Flag\n   - Present tense verbs\n   - Gerund forms (-ing)\n   - Missing noun or verb\n   - Ambiguous subjects\n   - Inconsistent verb forms\n\nExample Corrections:\n- Incorrect: \"Card | Create Payment\"\n- Correct: \"Card | Payment Created\"\n\n- Incorrect: \"PIX | Transferring Money\"\n- Correct: \"PIX | Money Transferred\"\n\n## Example Analysis Output\n\n```markdown\n# Taxonomy Analysis Report\n\n## Overview\nTotal Events: 50\nDistribution by Product:\n- Card: 10 events\n- PIX: 10 events\n- Payment Link: 10 events\n- Lending: 10 events\n- Ecommerce: 10 events\n\n## Key Findings\n1. Naming Consistency: 85%\n2. Property Type Distribution:\n   - Boolean: 25%\n   - String: 45%\n   - Number: 30%\n3. Description Completeness: 90%\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Standardize status properties across products\n2. Add timestamp properties to all events\n3. Include user_id as standard metadata\n4. Enhance error-related properties\n\n## Priority Improvements\n1. High Priority\n   - Add event correlation IDs\n   - Standardize error handling\n2. Medium Priority\n   - Enhance property descriptions\n   - Add event categories\n3. Low Priority\n   - Add optional metadata\n   - Implement versioning\n```\n\n## Interaction Style\n\n- Be analytical and thorough in assessments\n- Provide clear, actionable recommendations\n- Support suggestions with reasoning\n- Consider scalability and future maintenance\n- Focus on practical, implementable solutions\n- Use examples to illustrate recommendations\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Only suggest changes that maintain backward compatibility\n- Respect existing product domain boundaries\n- Consider system performance implications\n- Maintain data privacy best practices\n\nRemember to adapt these guidelines based on the specific context and requirements of the system being analyzed.",

High Priority\n   - Implement timestamp properties universally\n   - Standardize error-related properties\n2. Medium Priority\n   - Enhance property descriptions for clarity\n   - Introduce event categories for easier classification\n3. Low Priority\n   - Include optional metadata for additional context\n   - Consider implementing versioning for future scalability.\n\nIn the following sections, detailed analysis and recommendations will be provided for each aspect of the taxonomy. Let's dive deeper into the taxonomy for a comprehensive evaluation. \n\n---\n\n## 1. Taxonomy Overview\n\n### Naming Consistency\nThe naming consistency across the events shows room for improvement, with some inconsistencies in verb usage and noun identification. Further standardization is recommended to enhance clarity and coherence within the taxonomy.\n\n### Property Type Distribution\nThe distribution of property types is relatively balanced, with a slight skew towards boolean properties. Ensuring the relevance and appropriateness of property types based on the event context is crucial for maintaining a robust taxonomy.\n\n### Common Patterns\nCommon patterns observed include the use of camelCase for properties, PascalCase for product names, and past-tense verbs for event naming. These patterns demonstrate a foundational structure that can be further refined for greater consistency.\n\n### General Taxonomy Health Assessment\nOverall, the taxonomy exhibits moderate health, with opportunities for refinement in naming conventions, property descriptions, and type consistency. By addressing these areas, the taxonomy can be strengthened and made more resilient for future growth and scalability.\n\n## 2. Consistency Analysis\n\n### Naming Convention Adherence\nWhile the majority of events adhere to the recommended naming convention format, there are some instances where verb usage or noun identification can be improved for better clarity and alignment with best practices.\n\n### Property Naming Patterns\nThe property naming patterns generally follow camelCase conventions, yet there are variations in terminology that could benefit from standardization to enhance coherence and understanding within the taxonomy.\n\n### Description Quality and Completeness\nThe descriptions provided for properties show good overall completeness, with clear and specific details. However, ensuring consistency in the level of detail and relevance of descriptions across all events is essential for comprehensive documentation.\n\n### Type Consistency Across Similar Events\nConsistency in property types across similar events is crucial for maintaining a logical and coherent taxonomy. Verifying that related events share consistent property types can improve interoperability and ease of development.\n\n## 3. Gap Analysis\n\n### Missing Events in Product Lifecycles\nThere are no significant gaps identified in the product lifecycles, with a comprehensive set of events covering various stages from authentication to payment processing. However, further evaluation may reveal opportunities for additional events to enhance overall tracking and monitoring capabilities.\n\n### Incomplete Event Sequences\nThe event sequences appear well-defined, progressing logically from authentication to order processing and payment processing. Ensuring that each event in the sequence captures relevant information and triggers subsequent actions effectively is critical for a seamless user experience.\n\n### Missing Properties or Metadata\nWhile the existing events include essential properties and metadata such as timestamps and user_ids, there may be potential enhancements in error-related properties, correlation IDs, and additional contextual information to enrich the event data further.\n\n### Underrepresented Product Features\nAll core product features are adequately represented in the current taxonomy, with events covering key functionalities from user authentication to payment processing. Regular reviews and updates can help capture emerging features and ensure the taxonomy remains aligned with evolving product requirements.\n\n## 4. Enhancement Recommendations\n\n### Specific Suggestions for Improvement\n- Standardize timestamp properties for consistent tracking.\n- Enhance error-related properties for streamlined error handling.\n- Implement event correlation IDs for tracking event relationships.\n- Introduce event categories for easier classification and management.\n\n### Proposed New Events\n- Order | Order Cancelled\n- Shipping | Shipment Created\n- Review | Review Submitted\n\n### Property Type Optimization\n- Review and ensure the appropriateness of property types for each event context.\n- Consider optimizing boolean properties for clarity and ease of interpretation.\n\n### Description Clarity Improvements\n- Review and enhance property descriptions for greater precision and relevance.\n- Incorporate contextually relevant information to provide a comprehensive understanding of each property's purpose.\n\n## 5. Implementation Guidance\n\n### Priority of Recommended Changes\n1. High Priority:\n   - Implement timestamp properties universally\n   - Standardize error-related properties\n   - Add event correlation IDs for tracking\n   \n2. Medium Priority:\n   - Enhance property descriptions for clarity\n   - Introduce event categories for classification\n\n3. Low Priority:\n   - Include optional metadata for context\n   - Consider versioning for scalability\n\n### Potential Impact Assessment\nThe recommended changes aim to improve taxonomy consistency, clarity, and scalability, enhancing overall system robustness and usability. Implementing these changes incrementally can lead to smoother operations and better insights into product behavior.\n\n### Migration Considerations\nWhen implementing changes, consider backward compatibility with existing systems and data structures. Plan for gradual migration strategies to minimize disruptions and ensure a smooth transition to the updated taxonomy.\n\n### Version Control Recommendations\nMaintaining version control for taxonomy updates is crucial for tracking changes, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring traceability of modifications. Using version control tools and practices can support a structured approach to taxonomy management and evolution.\n\nBy incorporating these recommendations and guidance, the taxonomy can be refined and strengthened to better serve the needs of the product ecosystem. Continuous monitoring and updates will be essential to adapt to changing requirements and maintain a sustainable taxonomy framework.",
